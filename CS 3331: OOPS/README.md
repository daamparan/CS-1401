# Object Oriented Programming 
Continuing my Java experience OOPS gave a new look into how software is made. From polymorphism, inheritance, and security measures with private 
variables. OOPS allowed us to practice different techniques to develop our software. The main programs seen here
are the background of a Battleship-like game. Using concepts and techniques we built the layout without the full implementation. 

The Battleship-like game was the main project for this class that was built upon throughout the semester. Furthermore, depending on the topic, like
multi-threading, a seperate program is used (not Battleship-like game) to explore this topic.
