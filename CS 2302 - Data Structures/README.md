# Data Structures
This course was my first deep dive into Python as well as coding strictly data structures
these ranged from Linked List, trees, and hash maps. 

# Lab Reports
For each lab we were also tasked with writting a lab report, this can give you a peek into the 
documentation style I approached. I say approached because you my skills are constantly being redefined and evolving with each CS 
course I take.
