# Contents
The contents of this folder are split into different folders w/ each lab. 
This is because most projects have multiple contents within each. 
All the codes were ran within a VM on a cmd Linux distribution. If needed however, 
these codes were uploaded into an MSP-430. 

# More Info
The projects are found in their own respositories that are owned by Dr. Freudenthal and contain 
portions of code written by him.
