# Project 2 - Blinky Buzzy Toy

After being introduced to the C language and building a simple project that mainly dealt with pointers.
By using pointers we were introduced to pointer arithmentic and the general concept of these which led us 
to begin diving into assembly code and the translation between high level code to low level. 

Our first major project and my first use of actual hardware are demonstrated here. Much like Project 1 there 
is code provided by Dr. Freudenthal.
