# Past-Current-Labs
This repository contains Past labs from all (latest) CS courses I have taken during my academic 
career. Some CS courses, such as CS 1301 are missing an entry. This is due to not having access to those 
assignments any longer because of computers dying and software like blackboard not allowing to access past submissions/classes. 
Please feel free to look around, clone, and comment on any changes you'd make either good or bad. 

# Progress
The programs in the repository come from my beginning roots in CS to my latest, which gives an evolutionary 
take on my coding style, problem solving, and approaches. I hope this glimpse can allow you to infer the kind of 
worker and thinker I am.
