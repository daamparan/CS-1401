# Past-Current-Labs
This repository contains Past labs from all (latest) CS courses I have taken during my academic 
career. The repository is updated during semester or after depending on of course time. Please take a look around
this serves as a glimpse to the past from the very beginning (of what I still have of course). 
Some classes such as CS 1301 Intro do not have an entry due to loss of access to machine I used to write code 
at the time and things like Blackboard that do not show past submissions. 

# Progress
The programs in the repository come from my beginning roots in CS to my latest, which gives an evolutionary 
take on my coding style, problem solving, and approaches.
